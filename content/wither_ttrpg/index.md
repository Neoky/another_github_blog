## Monsters

* Frightener
Idea for a monster not in Official or Unofficial monster books yet. Immune to nearly all effects. They are very big and strong. Can be controlled by highly skilled mages.

## Tools

* TheWitcherTRPG
by AnthoyMonette. I have been meaning to try this out next time I start up Witcher TTRPG. It seems to be a self-hosted nodejs GM toolset for Witcher TRPG.
