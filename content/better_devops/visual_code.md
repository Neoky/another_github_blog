# Microsoft Visual Code

I do all of my work from a Windows machine. As much as I do not like to admit it. It's true. Everything I seem to do I do to make it feel more like a linux environment. A combination of VC and WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) really helps out with that feel.

## Preferred extensions

* Remote - WSL
by Microsoft: ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl
Integrate VC with WSL

* Markdown Preview Enhanced
by Yiyi Wang: shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced
Best for making READMEs and making a site in Hugo. Do not forget press CTRL+k (let go) then press v to bring preview up in a side-window.
