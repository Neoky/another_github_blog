# Crowdsec

Crowdsec is an opensource IPS. It can ingest a ton data sources, process the data, and create alerts, sends the data to the crowdsec central api for study, and send warning to bouncers to block the traffic. A bouncer is a tool from crowdsec you install along with services like nginx, wordpress, and cloudflare to name a few. You can download different parsers bouncer configurations from their hub page.
