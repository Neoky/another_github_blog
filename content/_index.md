### Welcome

# Neoky.Dev (Working Title)

Welcome to my blog. It's mostly going to be filled with tutorials for the various technologies I work with.

My name is Martin. I have been in tech for over 10 years now. I have a Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I started it of as a full stack Ruby on Rails developer working mainly freelance. I moved on to cloud infrastructures, primarly AWS. I went back to school to get my Master's where I got into Cybersecurity and made the labs for the Openstack course. Now I do Compliance, Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes, and at times upgrading code so old that the original devs are retired. Whenever I read something or do a tutorial. I always feels like there are steps missing. Hopefully people will find these useful. 

This site is built using Hugo. It's my first time using it and I am learning. I am using the Hugo-Theme-Learn by matcornic. It is deployed using deploy.sh by masterpi-2124.
